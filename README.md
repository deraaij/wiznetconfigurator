WIZNet WIZ1000 / WIZ110SR / WIZ1x0SR Configurator
=================================================

This project intends to perform the configuration over the network
of WIZnet WIZ1000, WIZ110SR / WIZ1x0SR devices.

This program is compatible with Linux, *BSD, and Windows.

How it works
------------
This program implements several configurator written by WIZnet,
but modified to support as many S2E devices as possible.

I only have WIZ1000 & WIZ110SR for now, so that's what I'm supporting.

Thoses devices can communicate over the network using broadcast to
find them, and configure them.
